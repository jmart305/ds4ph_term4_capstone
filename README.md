The goal of this project is to understand where and when 911 calls are being made in Baltimore and where and when high priority calls are being made so that that the appropriate emergency response teams can be prepared to respond to calls. Using data from the Open Baltimore API on 1.6 million calls throughout 2024, we began by analyzing important features of 911 calls including date, time, location, description of emergency, and priority of call. Calls are recorded in the data as having one of the following priority levels: Out-of-Service, Non-Emergency, Low, Medium, High, or Emergency.  

To visualize potential spatial trends, we organized the call data into 55 Community Statistical Areas (CSA), which are clusters of neighborhoods in Baltimore organized around Census tract boundaries.
